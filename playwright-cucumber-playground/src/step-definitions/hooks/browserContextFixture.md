### Note: Purpose of `browserContextFixture`

The `browserContextFixture` file defines a shared fixture object, `pageFixture`, which is used to manage and store references to the **Playwright browser instance** and **browser context** during test execution.

#### Key Points:
1. **`browser`**:
   - Represents the **Playwright `Page` instance**.
   - This is the main interface for interacting with a web page, such as navigating to URLs, interacting with elements, and capturing screenshots.

2. **`context`**:
   - Represents the **Playwright `BrowserContext` instance**.
   - A `BrowserContext` is like an isolated browser session, allowing multiple independent sessions to run in parallel within the same browser instance.
   - Useful for scenarios where you need separate cookies, storage, or authentication for different tests.

#### Usage:
- This fixture is likely used to share the `browser` and `context` instances across multiple test files or step definitions in your project.
- By initializing these properties in a `beforeAll` or `beforeEach` hook, you can ensure that the same browser and context are reused or properly isolated for each test.

#### Example Workflow:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The `browser` and `context` properties are initialized in a test setup hook (e.g., `Before` or `BeforeAll` in Cucumber).
   
2. **Access in Tests**:
   - Other step definitions or test files can access `pageFixture.browser` and `pageFixture.context` to perform actions on the browser or context.

3. **Cleanup**:
   - The `context` and `browser` are closed in a teardown hook (e.g., `After` or `AfterAll`) to release resources.

#### Benefits:
- Centralizes browser and context management.
- Reduces boilerplate code by reusing the same fixture across tests.
- Ensures proper isolation and cleanup of browser sessions.

This setup is particularly useful in projects that use **Cucumber with Playwright** for end-to-end testing.
